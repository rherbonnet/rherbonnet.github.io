I attended the [GravLens](https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~gravlens2016/) meeting in Leiden, The Netherlands. This meeting 
was held to discuss the past century since the theory of general relativity was first postulated.
I presented a talk on the shear measurement algorithm SNAPG which I had just published.
