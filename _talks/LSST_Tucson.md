As a member of LSST-DESC I attended the collaboration meeting held at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona at the end of
January 2020. The meeting was an occasion for all members to update on ongoing work related to science that is directly related 
to operations of the Vera C. Rubin Telescope or of general interest to the science goals.

In the clusters break out session I presented some highlights from my recently published works 
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07664.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04414.pdf). I also briefly discussed my ongoing work, a 
continuation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07664.pdf, to use cluster observables to inform on the bias in weak lensing 
measurements due to the orientation of the cluster dark matter halo. Large area surveys with thousands of galaxy clusters will 
provide the necessary statistical power for a clearer view on the relation between the brightest cluster galaxy and the halo.

In the photometric redshift break out session I presented some results on my ongoing project of using prism observations to 
generate low resolution spectra for thousands of galaxies simultaneously. This work aims to provide reliable redshift estimates 
in galaxy clusters. Galaxy clusters are very different environments than the fields generally used for redshift calibration, 
and it could be possible that calibrations from COSMOS introduce small errors in cluster weak lensing studies. The low resolution 
spectra could provide a cheap way to generate redshift calibration fields for galaxy cluster studies.
