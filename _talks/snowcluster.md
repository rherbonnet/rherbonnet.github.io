I attended the SnowCluster meeting in Snowbird, Utah. Snowcluster is a conference on the physics of galaxy clusters
[SnowCluster](http://www.physics.utah.edu/snowcluster/)

I presented a talk on the progress of weak lensing masses for a sample of 100 clusters and the difficulty in obtaining accurate mass estimates with weak lensing when statistical errors are decreasing.

__abstract__

The galaxy cluster mass function can place strong constraints on cosmological parameters, but only if accurate scaling relations between observables and weak gravitational lensing mass estimates are available. I will present results from a sample of ~100 massive clusters, extending the mass and redshift range probed by the Canadian Cluster Comparison Project (CCCP) with new measurements from the Multi Epoch Nearby Cluster Survey (MENeaCS). We explore the impacts of many sources of systematic errors for the weak lensing analysis: shear measurements, contamination of the source sample, obscuration of the source sample, photometric redshift distributions and conversion from shear to 3D mass and find that our results are still limited by the limited sample size. Our results allow for a reliable determination of a scaling relation with the SZ observable, which could help to explain the discrepancies seen in the Planck cluster cosmology.
