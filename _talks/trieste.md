Cluster Cosmology group of the
Observatory of Trieste

I was asked to give a talk for the Cluster Cosmology group of the Observatory of Trieste about my recent work on
cluster weak lensing mass measurements [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07664.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07664.pdf) 
and on the scatter in these measurements [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04414.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04414.pdf).
The talk, titled Accurate masses of galaxy clusters using weak gravitational lensing, was very similar to earlier presentations at Brown and Tucson.
