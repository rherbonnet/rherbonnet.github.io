About me
======
This is an incredibly brief description of me.

I was born in the Netherlands and now I'm in New York.

I like to play [underwaterhockey](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=underwaterhockey)

I like snowboarding, hiking

Work
======
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Lab since September 2017.
I work with Professor Anja von der Linden trying to accurately estimate weak gravitational lensing masses of clusters of galaxies, the largest objects in the Universe. Clusters can tell us how mass has built up over the lifetime of the Universe and that can put strong constraints on the nature of dark matter, dark energy and neutrino masses.



Collaborations
======

I'm a member of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) collaboration and LSST-DESC. Both are large optical surveys that are mapping or will map, respectively, millions to billions of galaxies in order to measure tiny coherent distortions in their projected shapes from which we can infer the distribution of mass in the Universe.

I joined the Weighing the Giants group.


Education
======
* Attended high school at the Stedelijk Gymnasium in Breda, the Netherlands 2000-2006 
* Bachelor of Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands 2006-2009 
* Bachelor of Astronomy at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands 2006-2009 
* Master of Astronomy at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands 2009-2012 
* PhD in Astronomy at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands 2012-2017

My PhD thesis *Unveiling dark structures with accurate weak lensing* is available online [here](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/55951)
